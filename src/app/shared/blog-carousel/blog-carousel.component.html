                    An axial flux motor (also known as an axial gap motor, or pancake motor) is a geometry of electric
                    motor construction
                    where the gap between the rotor and stator, and therefore the direction of magnetic flux between the
                    two, is aligned
                    parallel with the axis of rotation, rather than radially as with the concentric cylindrical geometry
                    of the more common
                    radial gap motor.[1]

                    Although this geometry has been used since the first electromagnetic motors were developed, its
                    usage was rare until the
                    widespread availability of strong permanent magnets and the development of brushless DC motors,
                    which could better
                    exploit some of this geometry's advantages. The axial geometry can be applied to almost any
                    operating principle (e.g.
                    brushed DC, induction, stepper, reluctance) that can be used in a radial motor. Axial designs can
                    allow some topologies
                    that would not be practical in a radial geometry. Even for the same operating principle, application
                    and design
                    considerations cause one geometry to be more suitable than the other. Axial motors are typically
                    shorter and wider than
                    an equivalent radial motor.

                    An axial flux motor (also known as an axial gap motor, or pancake motor) is a geometry of electric
                    motor construction
                    where the gap between the rotor and stator, and therefore the direction of magnetic flux between the
                    two, is aligned
                    parallel with the axis of rotation, rather than radially as with the concentric cylindrical geometry
                    of the more common
                    radial gap motor.[1]

                    Although this geometry has been used since the first electromagnetic motors were developed, its
                    usage was rare until the
                    widespread availability of strong permanent magnets and the development of brushless DC motors,
                    which could better
                    exploit some of this geometry's advantages. The axial geometry can be applied to almost any
                    operating principle (e.g.
                    brushed DC, induction, stepper, reluctance) that can be used in a radial motor. Axial designs can
                    allow some topologies

                    radial gap motor.[1]

                    Although this geometry has been used since the first electromagnetic motors were developed, its
                    usage was rare until the
                    widespread availability of strong permanent magnets and the development of brushless DC motors,
                    which could better
                    exploit some of this geometry's advantages. The axial geometry can be applied to almost any
                    operating principle (e.g.
                    brushed DC, induction, stepper, reluctance) that can be used in a radial motor. Axial designs can
                    allow some topologies
                    that would not be practical in a radial geometry. Even for the same operating principle, application
                    and design
                    considerations cause one geometry to be more suitable than the other. Axial motors are typically
                    shorter and wider than
                    an equivalent radial motor.
